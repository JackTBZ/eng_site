                        <h1>Means of Transportation</h1>
                        <p>
                            There are multiple ways to travel around Ho Chi Minh City.
                            my favourite way to travel is by van.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My father owns a 2014 Chevrolet Express 1500 Research.
                            It has four seats total, the two back seats being collapsable.
                            The back of the van smells terrible because of the mysterious
                            pee stains, blood stains and scratch marks.
                            I wonder what my father uses this van for. Considering
                            he goes to work in this van for entire days and sometimes even
                            overnight. I'm sure he's not doing anything terrible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But regardless, I like to sleep there on long trips.
                            After all, it's what I use to go to school every day!
                            It's a 4-wheeler, so traveling to school is very easy. It
                            only takes me 15 minutes to go from home to school.
                            Anywhere I go, I prefer going with this van over any other motorbike any day.

                            I used to prefer to shop in stores. 
                            I liked the experience of being able to try on clothes and see products in person. 
                            However, in recent years, I have become more and more comfortable shopping online.

                            There are a many reasons why I prefer shopping online. 
                            First, it is so much more convenient. 
                            I can shop from the comfort of my own home and I don't have to worry about traffic or gas. 
                            Last, it is a tiny bit more affordable. 
                            I can sometimes find better deals online, but most of them are still expensive.

                        <p>
                            I usually pay for my online purchases with a credit card. 
                            I like to use credit cards for its buyer protection. 
                            If I am not satisfied with a product, I can dispute the charge with my credit card company.

                        <h1>Bad experiences</h1>
                        <p>
                            I have gotten a few bad experiences when shopping online. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I once ordered a gun for 40 million vnd. 
                            But then my seller stopped contacting me for some reason. 
                            I couldn't get ahold of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another time, I ordered an electronic device that was defective.
                            I tried to return said product but the retailer refused to accept the return.

                            Everyday life requires many purchases from different sources.
