                        My name is Thanh Nhien. In this blog post, I would like to talk about
                        my favourite means of transportation.

                    <h1>Means of Transportation</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to travel around Ho Chi Minh City.
                        my favourite way to travel is by van.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My father owns a 2014 Chevrolet Express 1500 Research.
                        It has four seats total, the two back seats being collapsable.
                        The back of the van smells terrible because of the mysterious
                        pee stains, blood stains and scratch marks.
                        I wonder what my father uses this van for. Considering
                        he goes to work in this van for entire days and sometimes even
                        overnight. I'm sure he's not doing anything terrible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But regardless, I like to sleep there on long trips.
                        After all, it's what I use to go to school every day!
                        It's a 4-wheeler, so traveling to school is very easy. It
                        only takes me 15 minutes to go from home to school.
                        Anywhere I go, I prefer going with this van over any other motorbike any day.

                    <p>
                        For my next big trip, I will be going to the Philippines.
                        I'm going there to meet my online friends.

                        I'm going to take a plane to Manila with my parents in January 2024.
                        Since Tet lasts for 15 days, I'll be staying there for 10 days.

                        There are many ways to travel. But to each our preference.
                        We have discussed my favourite means of transportation
                        as well as my future travel plan.
