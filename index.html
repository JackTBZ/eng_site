                        My name is Thanh Nhien. In this blog post, I would like talk about
                        my favorite means of transportation.

                    <h1>Means of Transportation</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to travel around Ho Chi Minh city.
                        my favorite way to travel is by van
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My father owns a 2014 Chevrolet Express 1500 Research.
                        It has 4 seats with the 2 back seats being collapsable.
                        The back of the van smells terrible because of the mysterious
                        pee stains, blood stains and stratch marks.
                        I wonder what my father uses this van for. Considering
                        he goes to work in this van for entire days and sometimes even
                        overnight. I'm sure he's not doing anything bad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But regardless, I like to sleep there on long trips.
                        Infact, it is what I use to go to school everyday!
                        It's a 4-wheeler, traveling to school is very easy. It
                        only takes me 15 minutes going from home to school.
                        Anywhere I go, prefer going with this van over any other motorbike any day.

                    <h1>Travel Plan</h1>
                    <p>
                        For my next big trip, I will be going to the Philipines.
                        I'm going there to meet my online friends.

                        I'm going to take a plane to Manila with my parents in January of 2024.
                        Since Tet lasts for 15 days, I'll be staying there for 10 days.

                        There are many ways to travel. But to each our own preference.
                        We have discussed about my favorite means of transportation
                        as well as my future travel plan.
