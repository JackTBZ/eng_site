                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is Thanh Nhien. I am a big fan of shopping. 
                        I love the excitement of finding new things and the satisfaction of getting a good deal. 
                        I used to shop exclusively in stores, but in recent years, I have become more and more of an online shopper.
                        In this blog post, I will discuss my shopping habits. 
                        I will talk about where I shop, how often I shop, and what I usually buy. 
                        I will also talk about the factors I consider when I shop online, my payment methods, and my experiences with online and in-store shopping.

                    <h1>Buying Online or at Shops</h1>
                    <p>
                        I used to prefer to shop in stores. 
                        I liked the experience of being able to try on clothes and see products in person. 
                        However, in recent years, I have become more and more comfortable shopping online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a many reasons why I prefer shopping online. 
                        First, it is so much more convenient. 
                        I can shop from the comfort of my own home and I don't have to worry about traffic or gas. 
                        Last, it is a tiny bit more affordable. 
                        I can sometimes find better deals online, but most of them are still expensive.

                        I have gotten a few bad experiences when shopping online.

                        But then my seller stopped contacting me for some reason. 
                        I couldn't get ahold of them.

                        Another time, I ordered an electronic device that was defective.
                        I tried to return said product but the retailer refused to accept the return.
